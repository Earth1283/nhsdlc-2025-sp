# AT Immature Tech 

## Existing CRISPR works fine

[Li et al.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00447-x) 23 states, “Various robust methods have been established to deliver genome editing reagents ex vivo, some of which have been used in multiple clinical trials involving different diseases. The most efficient method of in vivo delivery of editors reported so far is AAV, which can deliver editor-encoding DNA to target tissues and has been applied in clinical trials.” This proves that existing CRISPR methods are sound and proven to work well.

## Long Term Solvency

According to Smith 24, “Furthermore, concerns regarding the high costs associated with germline genome editing will likely diminish over time as the technology advances and becomes more widespread. Consider the development of computers: once prohibitively expensive but now widely affordable.” This proves that long-term solvency is on the pro side, as with other technologies, we have reduced the prices significantly. In our constructive speech, we demonstrated that over 10 million percentage points have reduced the cost of CRISPR compared to data from a decade ago. Treatment costs have been reduced by over 70% 

# AT Job Loss

[Gray 2018](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181003-why-gene-therapy-will-create-so-many-jobs) states, “The UK government predicts there could be more than 18,000 new jobs created by gene and cell therapy in Britain alone by 2030, while the US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates it will see a 7% increase in jobs for biomedical engineers and a 13% increase in medical scientists, together accounting for around 17,500 jobs.”

# AT Inequality

## CRISPR Can Solve

Watters 21 states, “CRISPR-based diagnostics are now receiving their first test during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the DETECTR and SHERLOCK platforms were used to develop specific diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 within weeks of the WHO’s declaration of a public health emergency of international concern. In early May 2020, SHERLOCK became the first CRISPR-based diagnostic tool authorized for emergency use during the pandemic by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with authorization of DETECTR following soon after in late August 2020\. Both methods are rapid, with SHERLOCK producing results within 90 minutes \[84\] and DETECTR able to report results in approximately 30 minutes.” Thus, this quote proves that CRISPR treatments and similar methods can ease or mitigate the current health disparities. This allows everyone to create the best effects out of modern healthcare treatments. Furthermore, the same article writes that there is only a need for a cell phone camera and a laser scanner to detect viral outbreaks of COVID-19 among large crowds, eliminating the need for labs specifically for such purposes.

# AT Crazy Chinese Scientist

[CNN in 2023](http://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A740268092/OVIC?u=lom_accessmich&sid=bookmark-OVIC&xid=b2819c93) writes that “While the CRISPR baby scandal tarnished the technology's reputation, CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques have made a major impact on biomedical research, and two scientists behind the tool– Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna–won a Nobel prize for their work in 2020\. "Clinical trial results demonstrate that CRISPR is safe and effective for treating and curing human disease \-- an extraordinary advance given that the technology is only 10 years old.” This quote shows that while CRISPR has been proven safe in clinical trials on real people, it has now moved beyond the laboratory.

## Getting popularity

According to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/08/1178695152/china-scientist-he-jiankui-crispr-baby-gene-editing), the Chinese scientist who gene-edited two young girls was called by over 2000 patients with DND (Duchenne muscular dystrophy). To quote the interview, “they (the patients) are writing to me, texting me, making phone calls to me”. He later states that the patients wanted him to develop a treatment for them. This shows that the general public does not have a negative impression of CRISPR, even after the incident with the crazy Chinese scientist.

# AT Unsafe / AT Off Target

## Less frequency

A study posted on [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-35886-6) writes, "So far, no examples of unintended tumorigenicity of therapeutic gene editing have been reported to our knowledge in clinical studies, suggesting the frequency of these effects may be extremely low.” This proves that the frequency of off-target gene editing and its effects are extremely low. Even if such mutations or editing mistakes occur, their effects are minimized.

## Solutions

[Jeffery 24](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.22.590591v1.full) states that “Our top hit, PF-CAS-182, displayed comparable levels of activity to SpCas9 at on-target sites (median indel rates of 55.7% vs 48.3%), while having a 95% reduction in editing at off-target sites (median indel rates of 0.32% vs 6.1%).” This proves that novel approaches with AI can reduce the off-target effect rate by over 95%, allowing more precise genome editing in the long run.

## Detections

According to [CRISPR medicine news](https://crisprmedicinenews.com/news/off-target-effects-and-where-to-find-them/), CRISPR GUIDE-seq and CIRCLE-seq are the latest methods. With Circle-seq, the probe is not inserted into the cell (only a reaction tube is needed), which allows for easy detection and, subsequently, easy fixing of the problem.

# AT Expensive

## Traditional treatments worse

[U.S. National Library of Medicine](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11090833/) states that the lifetime costs of a patient with SCD in Africa, a continent that bears over 75% of the global SCD burden, do not have access to the newest treatments available for testing. Currently, there are no clinical trials on human beings for SCD in Africa, which only makes the problem worse. Nonetheless, the high upfront cost of gene therapy should not be the reason for tardiness in promoting gene therapy trials for SCD Africa, considering that the lifetime cost (by age 50\) of managing a patient living with SCD exceeds eight million USD. The cost of 8 million United States dollars is incredibly expensive to anyone on Earth, let alone poor people in Africa. This unaffordable cost will deter people from standard treatment, which costs around $50 a month in Nigeria alone. The average salary in Nigeria, which is just around [$60, should be noted](https://inquiresalary.com.ng/average-salary-in-nigeria/). Over the long run, this will become such an economic burden that many people quit treatment a few years in. However, gene therapy is more appealing to them as we can provide a one-time treatment to cure the disease, and no future fees will be needed. This will alleviate the economic hardship on African people affected by this disease in the long run.

## Gene Editing Cheaper

In an article published by the National Science Library, the long-term “traditional” costs of treating the most expensive cancers are $10 to $15 million, not accounting for the possible spillover costs. The costs will become prohibitive compared to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   the one-time up-front investment of a CRISPR treatment, which would likely help thousands of impoverished people in Africa.

# AT Bioweapon \[WEAK\]

According to [Vox](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/5/31/17344406/crispr-mosquito-malaria-gene-drive-editing-target-africa-regulation-gmo), Gene drives will not make viruses more aggressive. Gene drives only work on organisms that replicate sexually. This means they cannot be used to make viruses and bacteria more potent and harm people instead. Thus, this proves that with current technologies, not even top scientists can create artificially made stronger versions of biological weapons as of 2025, let alone criminal organisations with far worse talents and resources allocated.

# AT Gene Babies

## Aliases: None 

## Bad Public Opinion

According to the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2018/07/26/public-views-of-gene-editing-for-babies-depend-on-how-it-would-be-used/), 72% of Americans believe that genetically engineered babies are “taking technologies too far.” With a negative public opinion on such technologies, there will be no great public outlook if they are to be economized, meaning that nobody will want to purchase them (or profits will be too low), dissuading companies from developing such genetic medications.

## Logic

Even if the richer portion of the population has 100% trust in this new technology and decides, against all risks and red flags, to try this technology, a new “genetic elite” would form. Without government aid, the impoverished population could not access this new technology. This, in the end, will result in a richer population having far more genetic advantage over the poor, resulting in the rich being better in every way than the poor (as they have exploited human genetics to produce “perfect” babies. Ultimately, this will deepen the rich-poor gap to an irreversible degree.

# AT Trade-Off

## Aliases: AT Medicare; AT Medicare Trade Off

Fischer 24 states that, between annual bleed rates and required therapies to address hemophilia B, a patient with the disease can cost an insurer $20 million throughout their life, while the upfront cost of $3.5 million is significantly cheaper than the 20 million for their normal cures. This is bound to relieve more pressure on the US healthcare system, which already has tense healthcare resources.
