# AT Reducing Inequality

## General \- Top Shelf

[Saeed & Masters 21](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-021-01274-4) state that “Expanding access to human gene editing, a far more complex and expensive technology, risks creating a 'genetic elite' while leaving marginalized populations further behind. Until we address the systemic inequalities in healthcare access, we cannot responsibly expand access to gene editing without worsening existing socio-economic gaps.” Expanding access to human genome editing could worsen already-existing socio-economic gaps, worsening the rich-poor gap between everyone worldwide. In the end, the rich and elite would have the best “genes” designed for optimized performance everywhere, while the poor might still be struggling with fundamental poverty issues.

## Discrimination

[Sufian 21](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-dark-side-of-crispr/%20) states, “In the case of CRISPR, those choices are complex. CRISPR has many functions; one of these is that it can be used to treat disease. Yet the far-reaching, more fraught promise of this technology—one about which scientists seem excited and cautious—lies in its ability to eliminate from the gene pool what medical science identifies as faulty or abnormal genes that cause differences in individual people. However, our genetic conditions are not simply entities that can be clipped away from us as if they were some kind of misspelled word or an awkward sentence in a document. We are whole beings, and our genetic conditions are fundamental to who we are. These ideas also expose an even deeper, ableist assumption: that people with supposedly '**bad genes**” fundamentally suffer and hold a less valuable place in society than others.” Thus, this shows that people who undergo CRISPR to “fix” their genes will be discriminated against. This will also make people with genetic issues have a hard time living their lives, as they will be discriminated against in the long run.

# AT SCD

Munung states that, “where the cost of gene therapy for monogenetic conditions currently exceeds 1.5 million USD per patient. This exorbitant cost raises concerns about affordability for SCD patients in Africa, especially since many African countries do not have national health insurance programs or universal health coverage and rely heavily on out-of-pocket payments and/or external donor funding for healthcare. Additionally, most families/patients struggle to cover health expenses associated with basic SCD care, let alone the cost for managing SCD-related complications.” African countries are not able to afford even basic cures for sickle cell disease, which could be a serious problem for the pro side as it is their burden to implenet sickle cell disease’s cures throughout the world.

# AT HIV

## Ineffective

Highlyman [24](https://www.aidsmap.com/news/may-2024/crispr-gene-therapy-ebt-101-does-not-prevent-hiv-viral-rebound) states, “Of the five participants who received a single infusion of the initial dose of EBT-101, three stopped antiretroviral therapy. All three experienced viral rebound and had to restart antiretrovirals. This likely occurred because the gene therapy did not reach all cells harbouring latent HIV, and even a minimal number of cells containing residual HIV DNA is enough to re-establish viral replication.” This evidence 

## Other methods have proven to work

 According to the [Desmond Health Foundation](http://desmondtutuhealthfoundation.org.za/blog_post/strategies-hiv-cure/), there are alternative methods to cure HIV that have already been proven to be effective and safe. “Shock and Kill would ‘wake up’ these reservoirs to activate the silent virus. Whilst counter-intuitive, the idea is to wake up every virus and kill all the activated cells, destroying the reservoir in one go.” This quote shows that there are better ways to deal with latent or hiding HIV cells within the host’s body. The concept is to “wake up” the latent virus, and use an aggressive medication to kill the remainder of the HIV.

# AT Cancer

## Backfires

[Yale, in 2018](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/is-crispr-worth-the-risk), states, “A series of studies have suggested that CRISPR may cause cells to lose their cancer-fighting ability and may do more damage to genes than previously understood. What was previously attempted with gene editing was to manipulate genetic information in blocks, basically in big pieces. It’s like trying to edit a book by only being able to rip out a page at a time and transfer a page at a time without being able to control the actual words. This technology's power comes down to the individual letters.” This proves that current CRISPR editing technologies are insecure and can cause off-target effects and even backfire, canceling the intended effects. 

## Price & more issues

Science Direct states, "CAR T therapy is associated with limited targeting capability. Moreover, this method risks off-target effects, where other cell types may be inadvertently transfected instead of the targeted T cells.” Furthermore, Kaiser Health News specifies, "The per-patient cost of the recently approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel could exceed $1 million.” This proves that current gene therapy is not well-developed enough to handle such a large-scale deployment to developing nations.

# AT Cancer \- Short

## Please do not read if you are reading AT Cancer long ver; you may read this if you are planning on accompanying this with AT HIV.

[Gray (2018)](http://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A796908751/OVIC?u=lom_accessmich&sid=bookmark-OVIC&xid=b9e7f0a1%20) states that a series of studies have suggested that CRISPR may cause cells to lose their cancer-fighting ability and may damage genes more than previously understood. This shows that CRISPR will make cells that could once combat cancer lose their ability to do so, potentially making treatments backfire. Along with the unresolved risk of cancer due to CRISPR, this will make issues much worse for the patient.

# AT Cure Disease

## AKA: AT AI, AT Health

According to Feng 24, “Research on CRISPR delivery strategies requires intensive investigation and continuous improvement. Furthermore, future problems such as blocked delivery of large vectors, development of low-immunogenic Cas protein variants, and inefficient DSB repair must be addressed. In spite of the multitude  The complete elimination of these issues remains a challenge.” This means that large-scale deployments of CRISPR Cas-9 medication could be a significant stumbling block in the long-term development of this technology. This meant that humans have a long way to go from large-scale adaptation and scaling human gene editing. What benefit will immature technologies bring to the open market when they have unpredictable effects on humans?

# AT Supervirus

According to the [National Library of Medicine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6954843/), bacteriophages are an effective countermeasure for superviruses resistant to traditional antivirus drugs. This is a natural killer tool that infects bacteria and viruses inside the body of hosts until there are no more, leading to starvation of the bacteriophages, which will later die. The paper further states that bacteriophages have been regularly used in food preservation and packaging, which will not be something foreign to introduce to the human body. Contrary to CRISPR, phages only eat their target microbes and nothing else, allowing for precise attacks on certain bacteria instead of human cells.

# AT Prevent Human Extinction

The widespread use of CRISPR Cas-9 on humans could lead to homogenizing the human race. If one arrives, the human race will lack the needed gene pool to combat pandemics. Humans would face similar or even worse effects than the Native Americans’ response to the smallpox virus. This would result in humanity’s demise due to not having a large enough genetic pool to maintain partial immunity to a sudden disease.

# AT Germline

## Alias: AT Germline Editing

According to [CRISPR Medicine News](https://crisprmedicinenews.com/news/off-target-effects-and-where-to-find-them/), even if the Pro side magically eliminates almost all off-target effects, a 0.001% error rate could be deadly even when editing a small sample size of 10 million cells. This is minuscule compared to the human body’s [28 to 38 trillion cells](https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/how-many-cells-are-in-the-human-body-new-study-provides-an-answer). When magnified 100 times, this will only make preexisting issues worse, furthering the odds of cancer or negative off-target effects.

# AT Deregulation

## Alias: AT Patents, AT Evergreening, AT Fuck Patents

## Status Quo Bad

The healthcare industry's status quo is already bad enough, plagued by monopolies. Deregulating and removing patents will only make the problem worse. [MedCity News](https://medcitynews.com/2018/08/report-blames-gaming-of-patent-system-for-high-drug-prices/) writes that the 12 highest-selling drugs in the United States had, on average, 38 years of patent protection, while relevant legal regulations only permit 20 years of protection.  
The [Association for Accessible Medicines](https://accessiblemeds.org/resources/blog/anti-competitive-evergreening-delays-patient-access-more-affordable-generics/) furthers that 74 percent of new patents in the FDA’s records were associated with existing medications on the market. Of the 100 best-selling drugs, almost 80% obtained a patent extending the monopoly period beyond the initial patent's duration. This highlights the prevalence of evergreening within the pharmaceutical field, and deregulation by eliminating patents will only worsen the issue by further risking off-target effects and expensive prices.

## Better version, use this

[People's Pharmacy](https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-develop-a-new-drug#:~:text=One%20frequently%20cited%20analysis%20lists%20the%20cost%20to%20develop%20a%20new%20drug%20and%20bring%20it%20to%20market%20at%20%242.7%20billion.%20Now%20a%20new%20analysis%20published%20in%20JAMA%20Internal%20Medicine%20challenges%20that%20estimate.) writes that it costs around 2.7 billion to create a new drug, and the CRBA furthers that it takes 12 years for an experimental drug to travel from the research lab to the patient, which is extremely long. If the pro side is to remove all patents, this will remove the profit incentive for anyone to develop a new medication for an illness, the company spends 12 years and 2.5 billion to develop the drug. Without patents, other companies could immediately make the same drug for a much cheaper price and is fundamentally unfair to the company who researched and developed the drug all on their own. This would discourage innovation as there is no profit incentive for developing new drugs for the market. To add on, studies have shown that patents account for 80% of the pharmaceutical companies’ profits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

# AT Innovation Solves

[Guby 20](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1758-5899.12730) states that innovation will have a minimal effect on the prices and big pharma companies attempt to evergreen their patents in the long run, expanding their patent length over their traditionally accepted patent lengths. Drug companies with patents use patent clusters, evergreening, ads that manipulate doctors, and pay-for-delay schemes to keep their monopoly after the original patent has expired, so prices remain high. The ‘evergreening’ strategy is a form of blocking mainly used in the pharmaceutical industry. As the patent system allows improvements and additions to be patented, inventions that are just slight modifications of the old drug are patented. These secondary patents, usually filed just before the patent on the original drug expires and competition can start, each gain 20 years of protection.

# AT 99.7%

## Alias: AT fix off target

Just ask for the rest of the card and things

# AT GMO

[Ali 23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609045/) states that, “Due to collateral damage in the type II CRISPR/CAS system, it has limited specificity, meaning that off-target effects are more likely to occur. This can cause the superbug to undergo unexpected alterations, which might result in the emergence of new bacterial strains with higher antibiotic resistance.” This meant that the pro will still have to deal with bugs that the gmos were born to deal with.
